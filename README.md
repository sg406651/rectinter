# **Contents of This Repository**

This repository contains the **rectinter** tool to solve the problems of one- and two-set rectangles intersection, originally presented in *"An Optimal Worst Case Algorithm for Reporting Intersections of Rectangles"* by **J. L. Bentley and D. Wood**.

For a list of rectilinear rectangles represented by the coordinates of their lower-left and upper-right corners, it returns a list of rectangles that intersect each rectangle in the list.
